# LAGOS TRAFFIC

This repository comprises two projects. In summary it shows code on how to get traffic data of Selected locations from a Map-App (BingMaps, free), and then analyse the traffic data to test some hypothesis about patterns. The other alternative would be the use of Google Map's Distance MAtrix API, however there would be need to set-up a billing account for that.

```Null Hypothesis:```
There is no signnificant difference between road business in Lagos across the days of the week.

```Alternative Hypothesis:```
There is no signnificant difference between road business in Lagos across some of the days of the week.

The first part of this project deals with gathering traffic data over a minimum period of 1-Month. Data aquisition continues to feed the analytics framework more data to feed on, thereby increasing the accuracy of the conclusion. There are two alternatives for this part but this project uses the BingMaps API to collect traffic data .

The second part will attempt to provide insight into the acquired data, giving a summary of Traffic behavior in Lags State, Nigeria AND provide statistical evidence to support or reject the Null Hypothesis.

### NOTE:
The secret keys used referred to in the code file has been excluded from this repo for security reasons. Users who wish to use this code will need to generate their unique BingMaps API keys(to ping BingMaps API and collect traffic data) and Google Drive API keys(to write on Google sheets).
